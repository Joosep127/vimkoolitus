1. delete (d)

	In this exercise we’re going to learn how to delete text using motions.
	Remember: d is an operator, it does nothing on its own.
	It always needs a motion.

	This exercise commands

	d + where   - delete text covered by the motion

	dw   - delete word
	dd   - delete entire line
	d$   - delete to end of line - Alternative is command D


	1.1

		Delete the extra words using dw, db or de

		----->  The the cat sat on on the mat mat

		Goal
		----->  The cat sat on the mat

		Delete the correct lines (dd)

		Please change the line I don't like. ):

		I don't like this line



2. change (c)

	The change command works like delete,
	but puts you straight into Insert mode.

	c = delete + insert

	cw   - change word
	ce   - change to end of word
	cc   - change entire line
	c$   - change to end of line - Alternative is C

3. yank and paste (y & p)

	Yanking copies text.
	Pasting puts it after the cursor.

	y + motion   - yank text
	yy           - yank line
	p            - paste after cursor
	P            - paste before cursor

4. indenting (< & >)

	Indenting is very useful for code and structured text.

	>  - indent right
	<  - indent left
  >> - indent line
	<< - unindent line

	These also work with motions.


	4.1

		Indent the inner lines so it looks like a block

		if (condition)
		do_something()
		do_something_else()
		end

		Goal

		if (condition)
			do_something()
			do_something_else()
		end
