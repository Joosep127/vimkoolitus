2. words and WORDS

	This exercise is about navigating words and WORDS and teaching you what they terms mean and what are the commands

	a word is any words that contain only the alphabet, digits and underscores anything else and even without a space it becomes a new word

	a WORD is a word that contains any symbol, until the next space


	w = the start of next word
	b = the start of the previous word
	e = the end of the next word

	Use SHIFT to make these commands work for WORDS instead of words (W, B, E)

	
	We're also going to be using another editing command 'r'. It replaces a character with the one you press next

	r + {char} = replace the character under the cursor.
